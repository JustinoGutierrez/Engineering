    <p>9/2/22 - This week I learned how to cad. I explored around on Tinker Cad and figured out all of the features. On the final day of this week I made a cad of a blender for challenge day.</p>

    <p>9/23/22 - This week my group and I finished making our Rube Goldberg project but were interrupted by map testing but thankfully it didn't take that long. On the final day we were ready to test our project. After many attempts and some minor adjustments, we successfully popped the balloon.</p>

    <p>9/30/22 - This week was about computer engineering. We listened to a guest speaker on a zoom meeting who talked about computer engineering and what he does. Then we got to dissect laptops. It was super fun.</p>
