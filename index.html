    <p>9/2/22 - This week I learned how to cad. I explored around on Tinker Cad and figured out all of the features. On the final day of this week I made a cad of a blender for challenge day.</p>
    <p>9/16/22 - This week my group and I started making our Rube Goldberg project which we designed in Tinker Cad. On the final day we made paper boats and timed how long they could float in water for challenge day.</p>
    <p>9/23/22 - This week my group and I finished making our Rube Goldberg project but were interrupted by map testing but thankfully it didn't take that long. On the final day we were ready to test our project. After many attempts and some minor adjustments, we successfully popped the balloon.</p>
