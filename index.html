    <p>9/2/22 - This week I learned how to cad. I explored around on Tinker Cad and figured out all of the features. On the final day of this week I made a cad of a blender for challenge day.</p>

    <p>9/16/22 - This week my group and I started making our Rube Goldberg project which we designed in Tinker Cad. On the final day we made paper boats and timed how long they could float in water for challenge day.</p>

    <p>9/23/22 - This week my group and I finished making our Rube Goldberg project but were interrupted by map testing but thankfully it didn't take that long. On the final day we were ready to test our project. At first we noticed that our design was mostly luck based because it was not consistent. So we came up with the idea to add some sort of funnel to the bottom ramp. We didnt have any walls on the sides where the ball was flying out of so we added a wall to ricochet the ball into the hammer. I think that this was a great learning experience especially because we pointed out a problem and fixed it. This project was crazily fun and the balloon popping was super scary.</p>

    <p>9/30/22 - This week was about Computer Engineering. We listened to a guest speaker on a zoom meeting who talked about computer engineering and what he does. Then we got to dissect laptops. It was super fun.</p>

    <p>10/7/22 - This week was all about Bioengineering. First, we listened to a presentation about bioengineering and looked at prosthetic body parts for all kinds of animals. We then designed our own prosthetics and cadded them on Tinker Cad. I made a dolphin tale and fins. It was cool!</p>

    <p>10/13/22 - This week was about Aerospace Engineering. We listened to presentation and learned about what an aerospace engineer does and we watched some awesome rocket videos. Then we were given the task to make a bottle rocket which the class will be competing to see which group can launch their rocket the furthest. On challenge day we made flying paper and tried to throw them at a bucket. We were unsuccessful but it was still really fun.</p>
