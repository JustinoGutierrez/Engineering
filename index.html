        9/23/22 - This week, my group and I finished making our Rube Goldberg project but were interrupted by map testing but thankfully it didn't take that long. On the final day we were ready to test our project. At first we noticed that our design was mostly luck based because it was not consistent. So we came up with the idea to add some sort of funnel to the bottom ramp. We didnt have any walls on the sides where the ball was flying out of so we added a wall to ricochet the ball into the hammer. I think that this was a great learning experience especially because we pointed out a problem and fixed it. This project was crazily fun and the balloon popping was super scary.

        10/7/22 - This week was all about Bioengineering. First, we listened to a presentation about bioengineering and looked at prosthetic body parts for all kinds of animals. We then designed our own prosthetics and cadded them on Tinker Cad. I made a dolphin tale and fins. It was cool!

        10/13/22 - This week was about Aerospace Engineering. We listened to presentation and learned about what an aerospace engineer does and we watched some awesome rocket videos. Then we were given the task to make a bottle rocket which the class will be competing to see which group can launch their rocket the furthest. On challenge day we made flying paper and tried to throw them at a bucket. We were unsuccessful but it was still really fun.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">
        10/21/22 - This week, we mde made our bottle rockets and on Friday the class launched them. Mostly everyone's rockets launched but some groups were not able to launch due to leaks. Sadly, my group was one of those groups. We were unable to launch our bottle rocket because there was a small gap in between the connection of the two bottles. The gap was letting air through it and pressure could not build up so... we failed.

     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        10/27/22 - This week was all about environmental engineering. We learned how to prevent problems within our environment such as pollution, hazards, and anything else that can harm our environment. On the last day we made a water filter with cotton, sand, small rocks, and big rocks to filter out all of the dirt and clean the water. The challenge this week was to estimate how many candy corns we could fit on a paper. We guessed 216 but answers varied.

        11/4/22 - This week was about electrical engineering. It was very interesting and we learned about circuitry. We learned about Ohm's law which we can use to calulate Voltage, Current, and Resistance. The equation we used was V = IR. Then we went on tinker Tinker Cad and experimented with the bread board, circuits, and LEDs.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">
            11/10/22 - This week, we continued with our electrical engineering and actually went on to work with real circuits. We used what we learned from last week to work together and figure out how to get our LEDs to light up. Surprisingly, it was extremely similar to the Tinker Cad so we didn't have much trouble. We used a multimeter to measure the voltage and resistance of our LED circuits. On Challenge day we debated whether we would rather take a math class or write #'s 1-1,000,000. We decided to write the numbers because it would take less time.

            11/18/22 - This week, we used the arduino web editor on the arduino website to code our LEDs to light up in various patterns. Me and my partner, Xander, were successful in lighting up our LEDs in the correct patterns and timings. For our challenge we went around the school to find out whether there were more wheels or doors in the school. We claimed that there were more wheels and after a long discussion we concluded that there were more wheels than doors at school.

        12/2/22 - This week was about civil engineering and Mr. Kim told us that we would be making spaghetti bridges. These bridges would be made out of 20 pieces of spaghetti and glued together with wood glue. The bridge has to be 24 inches long which seems like a problem at the moment because we are limited to only 20 pieces of spaghetti.

    </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">
        12/9/22 - This week, we continued to work on building our spaghtetti bridge. We used, tablemate, Julian's Cad to make our bridge. We made a 24 inch long base and added support beams on top with our remaining noodles. Sadly at the end of the week, when we tested it, it broke.

    <p style="font-family:courier;">
        12/16/22 - This week, our class continued working hard on our bridges. My group was working on a new bridge because our first one broke. This time we would make the middle more flexible and the ends more sturdy. We put large globs of glue in the center to make it bendy and it looked promising but the next day it was dry, warped, and brittle. After that fail, we put our faith in, tablemate, Xander to make our final bridge.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">
        12/20/22 - This week was a stressful because it was finals week. Luckily this class was a breath of fresh air. We put all of our faith in, tablemate, Xander to make our final bridge and the day had finally come to test it out. Mr. Kim tied a bucket to the bridge and we were holding it down on the ends so it wouldn't fall. At this point(with the empty bucket) it was already bending. We were super nervous but it was able to hold one whole cup before it snapped and broke. I'd say this was a successful bridge.

        1/13/23 - For our first week back from Winter break, Mr. Kim started teaching us about business engineering. We learned about how business is very involved in engineering and how it is made of multiple branches of engineering. Our project was about starting up a business and making a product that can solve our everyday problems. The product that my group came up with was an app, called Resomate, that pairs random people together that share the same music taste. From there, they can exchange artists, songs, and expand there music taste.
    </p>
     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        1/20/23 - This week, Mr. Kim told us that we were going to start working on a big project. We had three choices. We could make a mousetrap car, an arduino car, or a campus research project. I didn't know what I wanted to do so I set that decision aside for later. On Friday, our challenge was so fun because we got to play with ooblek, which is cornstarch mixed with water. My ooblek turned out to be turquoise.
    </p>
     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        1/27/23 - This week, I had to make the decision about which project I wanted to do. Mr. Kim said that we would be working in pairs so I teamed up with tablemate, Xander. We both decided that we would be doing the mousetrap car project because it seemed like the easiest and most fun project. After choosing our project, we had type up our project proposal which was very easy and straight forward. We had to plan out what kind of materials we needed and how many cars we would make.

        2/3/23 - This week, we had to start working on our CADs for our projects. Tablemate, Xander, and I both wanted to make our mousetrap car really long to try to maximize our distance. We CADded our car on tinkercad and it was really important that we did so we could visualize how the car would work and figure out the perfect demensions.
    </p>
     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        2/10/23 - This week we continued working on our mousetrap car and actually started cutting out cardboard and putting it together. We used cds for the wheels, wooden stakes for the axles, cardboard for the boddy, and popsicle sticks for the arm. On Friday, our challenge was to make a device that could stably hold a water balloon while running in a race. We were limited to only using rubber bands and popsicle sticks. We were given a small amount of tape and a yard stick to hold our device. We made a cage that secured our water balloon in place. Tablemate, Julian, ran in the race and won even though he slipped up at the start. It was funny.

        2/17/23 - This week, tablemate, Xander and I noticed that our wheels on our mousetrap car were a little bit wobbly so we tried to figure out a better design for them. We put cardboard and duct tape on the hole of our wheels and poked the axle through it which seemed to do the trick. 
    </p>
     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        2/24/23 - This week was very easy because my partner and I were very far ahead in the development of our mousetrap car. We basically just chilled this week and took a super long break.

     <p style="font-family:courier;">
        3/3/23 - This was the week that we would finally test our project. The wheels were still a bit wobbly so we added some more cardboard, duct tape, and hot glue like 5 minutes before final testing. Our car performed great except it had made a full 90 degree turn. The wheels were still insanely wobbly which caused the car to make a right turn. Had the wheels been straight, we would have won for distance.

        3/24/23 - This week, Mr. Kim told us that we would be working on an egg drop project. We had to make a device that would keep the egg in good condition. My group decided to use a parachute to slow down the fall and straws and cotton balls to protect the egg from the impact. Supplies were limited but we still managed to protect our egg successfully. When we took our parachute off and dropped the egg a second time, it broke.
